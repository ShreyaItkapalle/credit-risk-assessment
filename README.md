# Credit Risk Assessment & Default Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project builds an end-to-end credit risk assessment model to predict the probability
of customer default. The solution supports data-driven lending decisions and portfolio
risk management for financial institutions by identifying risky customers early and
enabling risk-based strategies.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
The key objectives of this project are to:

- Identify high-risk customers before credit approval  
- Understand key factors influencing default behavior  
- Segment customers into actionable risk categories (Low, Medium, High)  
- Support informed, data-driven lending decisions  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-level information including:

- Demographic details (age, gender, education, marital status)
- Financial attributes (credit limits, bill amounts, payment amounts)
- Repayment history (past payment delays)

The target variable indicates whether a customer defaulted on the next payment cycle.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Reviewed data structure, data types, and variable distributions
   - Checked for missing values and class imbalance

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Removed non-informative identifiers
   - Selected relevant demographic, financial, and repayment behavior features

3. **Model Building**
   - Developed a Logistic Regression model to estimate default probability
   - Chosen for interpretability and industry relevance in credit risk modeling

4. **Model Validation & Threshold Optimization**
   - Evaluated performance using classification metrics and ROC-AUC score
   - Optimized classification decisions to reduce financial risk exposure

5. **Risk Segmentation**
   - Segmented customers into Low, Medium, and High-risk categories
   - Enabled actionable insights for lending strategies

6. **Business Insights & Recommendations**
   - Translated model output into practical business decisions
