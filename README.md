# Credit Risk Assessment & Customer Default Prediction

## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end credit risk assessment model to predict the probability of customer default. 
It supports data-driven lending decisions and portfolio risk management for financial institutions.

## Business Objective
- Identify high-risk customers before credit approval
- Understand key factors influencing default behavior
- Segment customers into actionable risk categories (Low, Medium, High)

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographics, financial attributes, and payment history variables.
- Stored in the `data/` folder as `credit_data.csv`.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


## Methodology
1. **Data Understanding** – Review data types, missing values, and distribution of variables.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Prepare categorical and numerical features for modeling.  
3. **Model Building** – Develop logistic regression model to estimate default probability.  
4. **Model Validation & Threshold Optimization** – Evaluate performance (ROC-AUC, confusion matrix) and tune threshold for business risk.  
5. **Risk Segmentation** – Categorize customers into Low, Medium, and High-risk groups.  
6. **Business Insights & Recommendations** – Translate model output into actionable decisions.

## Key Outcomes
- Developed a logistic regression model with strong predictive performance  
- Optimized classification threshold to reduce false negatives  
- Segmented customers into actionable risk categories  
- Generated output for downstream business use  

## Business Impact
The insights from this project help financial institutions:
- Reduce credit losses  
- Apply risk-based pricing  
- Improve portfolio risk management  
- Make informed lending decisions
