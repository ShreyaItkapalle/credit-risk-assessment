Project Title: Credit Risk Assessment & Customer Default Prediction

Project Overview:
This project aims to predict customer default probability and support data-driven lending decisions 
for financial institutions. It covers the entire analytics lifecycle, from data understanding and feature engineering 
to model development, validation, and actionable business insights.

Business Objective:
The objective is to reduce credit risk while enabling business growth by:
- Predicting high-risk customers before credit approval
- Identifying key factors influencing default probability
- Segmenting customers into low, medium, and high-risk categories

Key Outcomes:
- Built a logistic regression model achieving robust performance (ROC-AUC evaluation)
- Optimized classification threshold to minimize false negatives and financial loss
- Segmented customers and provided actionable recommendations for each risk group
- Generated a final risk-segmented output for use by business teams

Business Impact:
This project demonstrates how analytics can inform credit policies, 
risk-based pricing, and portfolio optimization, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.
